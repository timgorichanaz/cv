Clean academic curriculum vitae in LaTeX

Keeping up my CV in Pages became a hassle, 
so I remade it in LaTeX. It's a pretty standard 
format academic CV with some sophisticated details.

I decided to share the source in case anyone
else could benefit.

Let me know if you have any questions or ideas!
